# NBA Game Outcome Prediction

**By toommttom**

A Python-based machine-learning project that predicts NBA game outcomes (win or loss) using team box-score statistics from the 2022–2023 and 2023–2024 seasons.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to:

1. **Acquire & preprocess** NBA game data (regular season & playoffs).  
2. **Explore** basic statistics, distributions, and correlations.  
3. **Engineer features** by combining opposing teams’ box-scores into single rows.  
4. **Train** a Logistic Regression classifier to predict Win/Loss.  
5. **Evaluate** model performance across seasons and lineups.

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   # macOS / Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

2. **Install project dependencies**
