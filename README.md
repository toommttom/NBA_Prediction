## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to:

1. **Acquire & preprocess** NBA game data (regular season & playoffs).  
2. **Explore** basic statistics, distributions, and correlations.  
3. **Engineer features** by combining opposing teamsâ€™ box-scores into single rows.  
4. **Train** a Logistic Regression classifier to predict Win/Loss.  
5. **Evaluate** model performance across seasons and lineups.
